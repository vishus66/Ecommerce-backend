Project Name: Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB Backend Project backend for Ecommerce-sites

Description: This project is a backend application that uses Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to perform CRUD operations on data. The project is divided into three folders:

Controller: This folder contains the code for the application's controllers. Each controller is responsible for a specific set of operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
Module: This folder contains the code for the application's modules. Each module defines a specific data model, such as a user, product, or order.
Routes: This folder contains the code for the application's routes. Each route maps a URL to a specific controller method.
The project also includes a file called dbconnect.js that connects the application to the MongoDB database. The index.js file is the main entry point for the application. It loads the controllers, modules, and routes, and then starts the application listening on port 3000.

The project uses the bcrypt module to hash and salt user passwords. The password-validator module is used to validate user passwords.

Usage:

To use the project, clone the repository to your local machine and then run the following command:

npm nodemon 
Once the dependencies have been installed, you can start the application by running the following command:

nodemon index.js
The application will then be listening on port 3000. You can use the following API endpoints to interact with the application:

POST /users - Create a new user
GET /users - Get all users
GET /users/:id - Get a user by ID
PUT /users/:id - Update a user by ID
DELETE /users/:id - Delete a user by ID
